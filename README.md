# Tanki Offline

This is a submission for the CS2261 homework assignment. It is a single player game that takes inspiration from classic top-down tank shooters, where you must control a tank and take down all the enemy units. This project further explores the depths and limitations of the Mode 3 bitmap mode on the GBA. Further details on the game mechanics, controls, and game summary can be found [here](./HW03 Scaffold/README.md).
